# Online-Meeting-Software
In this project we are going to implement an online meeting software using WebRTC

## Online Meeting
We will not be building this project from scratch but instead watch this youtube video to use as a foundation and make sure everything works correctly on our computers. 

## Chatbox
After finishing the online meeting, we will implement a chatting function, this will allow the program to allow both video conference and also text chat.
