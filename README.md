# Online-Meeting-Software
In this project we are going to implement an online meeting and chatting software using WebRTC

## Online Meeting
We will not be building this project from scratch but instead [watch this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvlyzDZDEq4&t=00s) to use as a foundation and make sure everything works correctly on our computers. 

## Chatbox
After finishing the online meeting, we will implement a chatting function, using [this online video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzOqP9YwmM) this will allow the program to allow both video conference and also text chat.
